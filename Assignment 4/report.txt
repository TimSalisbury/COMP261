My program implements all of the first three stages, and parts of the fourth stage. Proper variable scoping is implemented in the robot class, this is done
by taking a snapshot of all the variables assigned/declared at the start of a block, at the end of the same block all variables in the map are removed apart from
the ones that were recorded in the snapshot.

For declaration of variables and scoping I used a tree data structure, where the variables are stored in a VariableTreeNode, which holds the variables and the parent
VariableTreeNode to it. This means if we try to reference a variable in a scope and it doesn't exist in the VariableTreeNode associated with that block node then it can ascend
up the tree and attempt to find the variable that way by checking higher up scopes. If the variable is not found then an exception is thrown.
